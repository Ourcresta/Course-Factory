


You are acting as:

* Senior Full-Stack Engineer
* Senior LMS Platform Architect
* Senior Product Designer

You are working inside an existing **AISiksha – Course Factory (Admin Portal)**.

The system already has:

* Courses
* Modules & Lessons
* Tests Manager
* Certificate Designer
* Global Skills Library
* Course Publishing workflow

Your task is to **design and implement a COMPLETE Project Manager module**, **Admin-only**, **course-scoped**, and **future-proof**, without touching learner-side features.

---

## 🧩 HIGH-LEVEL GOAL

Build **Projects Manager** so admins can add **real-world projects** to a course and optionally require project completion for certification.

This must fully support the existing certificate rule:

> “Requires Project Completion”

---

## 📍 ROUTING & SCOPE (VERY IMPORTANT)

Projects must be **course-scoped**, NOT global.

### Required routes:

```
/courses/:courseId/projects
/courses/:courseId/projects/:projectId
```

DO NOT create:

* Global `/projects`
* Skill creation inside projects

---

## 🧱 DATA MODEL (CONCEPTUAL – IMPLEMENT ACCORDING TO STACK)

Each **Project** must contain:

* `id`
* `courseId`
* `title` (required)
* `description`
* `objectives` (text / bullet)
* `deliverables` (text / checklist)
* `submissionInstructions`
* `evaluationNotes` (optional, admin-only)
* `skills` → array of skill IDs (from Skills Library)
* `status` → `draft | locked`
* `createdAt`
* `updatedAt`

---

## 🖥️ UI REQUIREMENTS

### 1️⃣ Projects List Page

(`/courses/:courseId/projects`)

* Header: **Course Projects**
* CTA: `+ Add Project`
* Empty state:

  * Icon
  * Text: *“No projects yet”*
  * Subtitle: *“Add real-world projects to give students hands-on experience”*
  * Button: **Generate with AI** (UI only placeholder for now)

Each project card should show:

* Project title
* Short description
* Skill tags
* Status badge: Draft / Locked
* Actions:

  * Edit
  * Delete (only if draft)

---

### 2️⃣ Add / Edit Project Page

(`/courses/:courseId/projects/:projectId`)

Form sections (clear separation):

#### 🔹 Project Details

* Title (required)
* Description (textarea)

#### 🔹 Objectives

* Textarea or bullet-style input

#### 🔹 Deliverables

* Textarea (what learner must submit)

#### 🔹 Submission Instructions

* Textarea (GitHub link, PDF upload, demo, etc.)

#### 🔹 Skill Mapping

* Multi-select dropdown
* Pull from **global Skills Library**
* DO NOT create skills here

#### 🔹 Evaluation Notes (Admin Only)

* Optional
* Not visible to learners

#### 🔹 Actions

* Save (Draft)
* Save & Lock (if course is published → disable editing)

---

## 🔐 RULES & GUARDS (CRITICAL)

### Publishing behavior:

* If **course is published**:

  * Projects become **read-only**
  * Show info banner:

    > “This project is locked because the course is published”

### Certificate dependency:

* If certificate has **Requires Project Completion = ON**

  * Validate that **at least one project exists**
  * Show warning in:

    * Publish tab
    * Projects tab banner

---

## 🔄 INTEGRATIONS

### Certificate tab:

* If project requirement is enabled:

  * Show status:

    * ✅ Project configured
    * ❌ No project added

### Course overview:

* Project count card updates dynamically

---

## 🧪 TESTING CHECKLIST (REPLIT MUST SELF-TEST)

* Add project → appears in list
* Edit project → updates correctly
* Skill mapping works (no duplicates)
* Delete allowed only in draft
* Lock enforced after publish
* Certificate rule reacts correctly
* No global project leakage across courses

---

## ❌ DO NOT BUILD (IMPORTANT)

* ❌ Learner project submission UI
* ❌ File uploads
* ❌ Grading workflow
* ❌ AI evaluation
* ❌ Notifications

These come later in **Learn Portal phase**.

---

## 🎨 UI / UX GUIDELINES

* Follow existing AISiksha Admin design
* Use same cards, spacing, buttons, badges
* Clean, enterprise-grade look
* Clear empty states and helper text

---

## 🏁 DEFINITION OF DONE

Projects Manager is considered DONE when:

* Admin can add/edit/delete course projects
* Skills can be mapped per project
* Certificate “Requires Project Completion” is enforceable
* Everything locks correctly after publish
* No impact on existing Tests / Certificates / Skills

---

### ✅ FINAL INSTRUCTION TO REPLIT AI

Build this **cleanly**, **incrementally**, and **without refactoring existing modules unless required**.
If any assumption is unclear, **pause and ask before implementing**.
